# About Hitbloq
Hitbloq offers a unique competitive experience for Beat Saber by allowing you to compete on numerous user-created map pools.
Each map pool has its own ranked ladder and curves.
Hitbloq uses ScoreSaber for data, so this mod **does not** perform score submissions. ScoreSaber is required for scores to submit and the Hitbloq mod will simply alert the service to "refresh" scores (fetch them from ScoreSaber).

## Features
- View leaderboards for Hitbloq ranked maps
- Switch between pools
- Open the playlist of the selected pool (requires PlaylistManager)
- Automatically refresh your score after setting a new PB
- View profiles of other users
- Add other users to your friends list for score comparison
- Automatically register for a Hitbloq account if one does not exist
- View information on Hitbloq events ingame

**Note**: The leaderboard will only appear for Hitbloq ranked maps. Select a Hitbloq map and click the arrow to the right of ScoreSaber to use it.
